# **Notable Challenges and Solutions**

**Canvas State Management:** Managing the canvas state for undo/redo functionality was challenging. We solved this by implementing a stack-based state management system, allowing users to easily revert to previous versions of their drawing.

**Brush Performance:** Ensuring smooth brush strokes without lag was initially difficult. We optimized the rendering process using requestAnimationFrame, which significantly improved the brush performance.
